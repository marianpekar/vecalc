# Vecalc

Vecalc (Vector Calculator) is a little web-based helper for basic vector math.

Release: https://marianpekar.github.io/vecalc/

It takes two vectors on the input (via dat-gui on the top right corner) and computes their **addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, magnitudes of all vectors, the angles among them and also between each axis for each of them as well**. The Angles are shown both in **degrees and radians**.

All the outputs are presented in the top left corner. Its precision could be set from 1 to 5 decimals via dat-gui.

Both vectors and their cross product are visualized in 3D space with axes thanks to THREE.js. In case you want to see normalized versions of the vectors, in dat-gui tick **Show Normalized**. You can also hide axis by unticking **Show Axes**

You can **move around** on sine wave using **left and right keys (or A and D)** and **zoom-in/out** using **up and down arrows (W/D)**.
